# MDDB Ontology
MDDB is a consortium whose endeavour is to build a unified database that compiles and organises all data generated by molecular dynamics simulations thus making it accessible to a wider scientific community.
<br />
<br />
This repository is aimed to save and report issues of the MD ontology and metadata specification.
<br />
<br />
Here is stored a backup of the ontology developed in [Web Protégé](https://webprotege.stanford.edu/#projects/3f319613-2423-446e-af3f-dfdfe45a509a/edit/Classes).
<br />
Also there is a backup of the [Metadata specification](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WIfFnj_cp1aQaHYiwTlfkjznCttDE8CGXoV4TQa0yyo/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
<br />
<br />
If you are willing to contribute to the ontology/metadata specification or have any suggestions please open an issue in this repository or make a pull request.
